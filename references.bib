  abstract = {Numerical simulations of strongly correlated electron systems suffer from the notorious fermion sign problem which has prevented progress in understanding if systems like the Hubbard model display high-temperature superconductivity. Here we show how the fermion sign problem can be solved completely with meron-cluster methods in a large class of models of strongly correlated electron systems, some of which are in the extended Hubbard model family and show s-wave superconductivity. In these models we also find that on-site repulsion can even coexist with a weak chemical potential without introducing sign problems. We argue that since these models can be simulated efficiently using cluster algorithms they are ideal for studying many of the interesting phenomena in strongly correlated electron systems. © 2003 Elsevier B.V.

  abstract = {A review of the loop algorithm, its generalizations, and its relation to some other Monte Carlo techniques is given. The loop algorithm is a quantum Monte Carlo procedure that employs non-local changes of worldline configurations, determined by local stochastic decisions. It is based on a formulation of quantum models of any dimension in an extended ensemble of worldlines and graphs, and is related to Swendsen-Wang algorithms. It can be represented directly on an operator level, both with a continuous imaginary time path integral and with the stochastic series expansion. It overcomes many of the difficulties of traditional worldline simulations. Autocorrelations are reduced by orders of magnitude. Grand-canonical ensembles, off-diagonal operators, and variance reduced estimators are accessible. In some cases, infinite systems can be simulated. For a restricted class of models, the fermion sign problem can be overcome. Transverse magnetic fields are handled efficiently, in contrast to strong diagonal fields. The method has been applied successfully to a variety of models for spin and charge degrees of freedom, including Heisenberg and XYZ spin models, hard-core bosons, Hubbard and t-J-models. Owing to the improved efficiency, precise calculations of asymptotic behaviour and of quantum critical exponents have been possible.},

   abstract = {Abelian and non-Abelian gauge theories are of central importance in many areas of physics. In condensed matter physics, Abelian U(1) lattice gauge theories arise in the description of certain quantum spin liquids. In quantum information theory, Kitaev's toric code is a Z(2) lattice gauge theory. In particle physics, Quantum Chromodynamics (QCD), the non-Abelian SU(3) gauge theory of the strong interactions between quarks and gluons, is nonperturbatively regularized on a lattice. Quantum link models extend the concept of lattice gauge theories beyond the Wilson formulation, and are well suited for both digital and analog quantum simulation using ultracold atomic gases in optical lattices. Since quantum simulators do not suffer from the notorious sign problem, they open the door to studies of the real-time evolution of strongly coupled quantum systems, which are impossible with classical simulation methods. A plethora of interesting lattice gauge theories suggests itself for quantum simulation, which should allow us to address very challenging problems, ranging from confinement and deconfinement, or chiral symmetry breaking and its restoration at finite baryon density, to color superconductivity and the real-time evolution of heavy-ion collisions, first in simpler model gauge theories and ultimately in QCD. © 2013 by WILEY-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co.

  abstract = {In order to better understand what to expect from numerical CORE computations for two-dimensional massless QED (the Schwinger model) we wish to obtain some analytic control over the approach to the continuum limit for various choices of fermion derivative. To this end we study the Hamiltonian formulation of the lattice Schwinger model (i.e., the theory defined on the spatial lattice with continuous time) in $A_0=0$ gauge. We begin with a discussion of the solution of the Hamilton equations of motion in the continuum, we then parallel the derivation of the continuum solution within the lattice framework for a range of fermion derivatives. The equations of motion for the Fourier transform of the lattice charge density operator show explicitly why it is a regulated version of this operator which corresponds to the point-split operator of the continuum theory and the sense in which the regulated lattice operator can be treated as a Bose field. The same formulas explicitly exhibit operators whose matrix elements measure the lack of approach to the continuum physics. We show that both chirality violating Wilson-type and chirality preserving SLAC-type derivatives correctly reproduce the continuum theory and show that there is a clear connection between the strong and weak coupling limits of a theory based upon a generalized SLAC-type derivative.},

The local gauge symmetry is realized in an optical superlattice, using heteronuclear boson-fermion spin-changing interactions which preserve the total spin in every local collision. We consider a large number of bosons residing in the coherent state of a Bose-Einstein condensate on each link between the fermion lattice sites, such that the behavior of lattice QED in the continuum limit can be recovered. The discussion about the range of possible experimental parameters builds, in particular, upon experiences with related setups of fermions interacting with coherent samples of bosonic atoms. We determine the atomic system's parameters required for the description of fundamental QED processes, such as Schwinger pair production and string breaking. This is achieved by benchmark calculations of the atomic system and of QED itself using functional integral techniques. Our results demonstrate that the dynamics of one-dimensional QED may be realized with ultracold atoms using state-of-the-art experimental resources. The experimental setup proposed may provide a unique access to longstanding open questions for which classical computational methods are no longer applicable.},

  abstract      = {The high level of control and precision achievable in current synthetic quantum matter setups has enabled first attempts at quantum-simulating various intriguing phenomena in condensed matter physics, including those probing thermalization or its absence in closed quantum systems. In a recent work [Desaules \textit{et al.} [arXiv:2203.08830], we have shown that quantum many-body scars -- special low-entropy eigenstates that weakly break ergodicity in nonintegrable systems -- arise in spin-$S$ quantum link models that converge to $(1+1)-$D lattice quantum electrodynamics (Schwinger model) in the Kogut--Susskind limit $S\to\infty$. In this work, we further demonstrate that quantum many-body scars exist in a truncated version of the Schwinger model, and are qualitatively more prominent than their counterparts in spin-$S$ quantum link models. We illustrate this by, among other things, performing a finite-$S$ scaling analysis that strongly suggests that scarring persists in the truncated Schwinger model in the limit $S\to\infty$. Although it does not asymptotically converge to the Schwinger model, the truncated formulation is relevant to synthetic quantum matter experiments, and also provides fundamental insight into the nature of quantum many-body scars, their connection to lattice gauge theories, and the thermalization dynamics of the latter. Our conclusions can be readily tested in current cold-atom setups.},

Their properties are often probed in dynamical experiments, such as those performed at ion colliders and high-intensity laser facilities. Describing the evolution of these strongly coupled systems is a formidable challenge for classical computers, and represents one of the key open quests for quantum simulation approaches to particle physics phenomena. Here, we show how recent experiments done on Rydberg atom chains naturally realize the real-time dynamics of a lattice gauge theory at system sizes at the boundary of classical computational methods. We prove that the constrained Hamiltonian dynamics induced by strong Rydberg interactions maps exactly onto the one of a $U(1)$ lattice gauge theory. Building on this correspondence, we show that the recently observed anomalously slow dynamics corresponds to a string-inversion mechanism, reminiscent of the string-breaking typically observed in gauge theories. This underlies the generality of this slow dynamics, which we illustrate in the context of one-dimensional quantum electrodynamics on the lattice. Within the same platform, we propose a set of experiments that generically show long-lived oscillations, including the evolution of particle-antiparticle pairs. Our work shows that the state of the art for quantum simulation of lattice gauge theories is at 51 qubits, and connects the recently observed slow dynamics in atomic systems to archetypal phenomena in particle physics},
